The Analyses aim to give insight on sales performance via revenue generation(from each product category and subcategory featured in the Dataset) across a period of six months. It also aims to give insight on sales by four different customer segments(Corporate, Home Office, Small Business and Consumer).

Data Source

Dataset is from Acme Software Lab.

Tools
• Microsoft Excel
• Microsoft PowerBI

Data Cleaning and Preparation

The data is generally clean enough, apart from a white space on one of the columns which was removed. Data cleaning and preparation was carried out in PowerBi. Original dataset was provided in csv format.

Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
Objectives of EDA:
EDA involved creating visuals to give insight on what’s up with the business.

Results and findings

From the analysis of data, the following can be inferred;
1. Corporate customers have the highest patronage(34%)followed by small businesses(24%). But small business bring a higher return($0.07m profit) as compared to the Corporate and the rest($0.05m).
2. ⁠(Top five sales). Office Machines have the highest sales in product sub-category, followed by
• Chairs & chairmats
• ⁠Telephone and communication
• ⁠Tables
• ⁠Binders and Accessories.

3. ⁠Bottom Five product subcategory by Sales are;
• Pens and Arts Supplies
• ⁠Envelopes
• ⁠Scissors rulers trimmers
• ⁠Labels
• ⁠Rubber band.
Rubber band is the least of sales in product sub-category.

4. ⁠Binders and Binder Accessories are the most profitable product in product sub-category, followed by
• Chairs and chairmat
• ⁠Telephones and communication
• ⁠Copiers and Fax
• ⁠Office Furnitures

5. Below are the bottom six least performing products with a negative revenue return(Loss).

• Rulers and Trimmers
• Rubber Band

6. Sales are highest in April and lowest in march.

7. ⁠Office Supply has the highest profit in product category.

8. ⁠Technology items are the most sold in the product category.

9. ⁠There’s a flunctuating pattern in monthly sales with increment and decrement following each other sequentially.

Conclusion and Recommendation

1. There are six low performing products that the company can stop selling with immediate effect. It can be inferred that they are not just low performing but bad performing, returning a loss and reducing overall revenue return.

These products are;

• Pens and art supplies
• ⁠Bookcases
• ⁠Envelopes
• ⁠Scissors, rulers and trimmers.
• ⁠Rubber band
• ⁠Tables
They amount to a loss of $12, 458.48 which is about 5.56% of total profit.

2. Office Machines is the top Product Sub-category by sales. The implication of this is that Office Machines is the most sold item. However, it returns a very low profit. To maximize profit on this highly sought product, company needs to have an upward review of it’s Selling price.
Office machine contributes about 3.94% of total profit as compared to a relatively less sought product(Binders and Binder accessories, 4th by sales) which boasts about 26.46% of the total profit. 

3. To prevent further profit loss, discounts should be removed totally from less profitable items and focused on more profitable items.

4. ⁠Discount should be removed from products with low sales(as this has no effect on sales).

5. ⁠Products sub-categories with high sales and low profit(e.g Storage and organization) should have an upward review on selling price while products sub-categories with low sales and high revenue return(profit) should be discounted.

Limitations:

There are no limitations in the analysis and exploration of this dataset.
