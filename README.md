## Conclusion and Recommendation
---

1. There are six low performing products that the company can stop selling with immediate effect. It can be inferred that they are not just low performing but bad performing, returning a loss and reducing overall revenue return.

These products are;

  -  Pens and art supplies
  -  Bookcases
  -  envelopes
  -  sccissors, rulers and trimmers.
  -  rubber band
  -  tables

They amount to a loss of $12, 458.48 which is about 5.56% of total profit.

2. Office Machines is the top Product Sub-category by sales. The implication of this is that Office Machines is the most sold item. However, it returns a very low profit. To maximize profit on this highly sought product, company needs to have an upward review of it’s Selling price.
Office machine contributes about 3.94% of total profit as compared to a relatively less sought product(Binders and Binder accessories, 4th by sales) which boasts about 26.46% of the total profit. 

3. To prevent further profit loss, discounts should be removed totally from less profitable items and focused on more profitable items.

4. ⁠Discount should be removed from products with low sales(as this has no effect on sales).

5. ⁠Products sub-categories with high sales and low profit(e.g Storage and organization) should have an upward review on selling price while products sub-categories with low sales and high revenue return(profit) should be discounted.
